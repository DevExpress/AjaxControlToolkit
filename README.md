# AJAX Control Toolkit – Repository Archived

Dear Community,

As previously announced, the AJAX Control Toolkit repository has been archived as of today. This repository is now in a read-only state, meaning no new issues or pull requests will be accepted.

## Resources:

* The archived repository will remain accessible for reference purposes at [https://github.com/DevExpress/AjaxControlToolkit/](https://github.com/DevExpress/AjaxControlToolkit/).
* For those looking to transition to modern technologies, we recommend exploring the [ASP.NET Core framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet) and its associated libraries, which offer enhanced performance, security, and modern features.
* Developers who are considering modern frontend technologies can explore JavaScript frameworks, such as React, Angular, or Vue, which pair well with [.NET for backend services](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/apis) to build performant and scalable applications.
* You can also add beautiful UI and extended functionality to your .NET applications by leveraging tools from vendors in the [.NET ecosystem](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/community), such as the DevExpress suite ([https://www.devexpress.com/](https://www.devexpress.com/)), which continues to provide valuable components for enhancing your app’s appearance and capabilities.

Thank you once again for being a part of the AJAX Control Toolkit journey. We appreciate your support and contributions over the years.
