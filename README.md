# AJAX Control Toolkit â€“ Notice of Intent to Archive

Dear Community,

After careful consideration, we have decided to archive the AJAX Control Toolkit repository in 30 days. This decision comes as part of our commitment to focusing on modern web development technologies and ensuring that our resources are aligned with the future direction of the ASP.NET platform.

## What This Means:

* **No Further Development:** After the repository is archived, it will be in a read-only state. No new issues or pull requests will be accepted.
* **Community Support:** The existing content will remain available for reference, but there will be no official support or updates from DevExpress.
* **Future Guidance:** We encourage developers to explore modern alternatives within the ASP.NET ecosystem that provide up-to-date functionality and support.

## Next Steps:

* We will archive this repository on October 1, 2024.
* During this period, we welcome feedback and will be monitoring the repository to answer any final questions or concerns.
  
We appreciate your understanding and thank you for your support of the AJAX Control Toolkit over the years.

Best regards,
The DevExpress Team
