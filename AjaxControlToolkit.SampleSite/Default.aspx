   <p>
 The ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit is an open-source project built on top of the Microsoft ASP.NET AJAX framework. 
It is a joint effort between Microsoft and the ASP.NET AJAX community that provides a powerful infrastructure to write reusable, 
customizable and extensible ASP.NET AJAX extenders and controls, as well as a rich array of controls that 
can be used out of the box to create an interactive Web experience.
   </p>
    <br />
    <p>
The AJAX Control Toolkit contains more than 30 controls that enable you to easily create rich, interactive web pages.
