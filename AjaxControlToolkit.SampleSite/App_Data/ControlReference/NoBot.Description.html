 NoBot is a control that prevents CAPTCHA-like bot/spam without user interactions. This approach is easier to bypass than the implementation that requires actual human intervention, but NoBot has the benefit of being completely invisible. NoBot is probably most relevant for low-traffic sites where blog/comment spam is a problem and 100% effectiveness is not required.
