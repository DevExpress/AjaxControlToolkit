 CascadingDropDown is an ASP.NET AJAX extender that can be attached to an ASP.NET DropDownList control to get automatic population of a set of DropDownList controls. Each time selection of one DropDownList control changes, CascadingDropDown makes a call to a specified web service to retrieve the list of values for the next DropDownList in the set.
