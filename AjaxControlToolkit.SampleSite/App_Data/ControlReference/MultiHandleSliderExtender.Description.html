 The MultiHandleSlider extender provides a feature-rich extension to a regular asp:Textbox control. It allows you to choose a single value or multiple values in a range through a graphical slider interface. It supports one handle, dual handles, or any number of handles bound to values of the asp:TextBox or asp:Label controls. It also provides options for read-only access, custom graphic styling, hover and drag handle styles, as well as the mouse and keyboard support for accessibility.
