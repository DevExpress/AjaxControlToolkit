 PagingBulletedList is an ASP.NET AJAX extender that can be attached to an ASP.NET BulletedList control and provide client-side sorted paging. It is very flexible and lets you specify either the number of characters used in the heading indices or the maximum number of items to display per index. If the input is not sorted (either on the server or client), it will generate more header indices but still function appropriately.
