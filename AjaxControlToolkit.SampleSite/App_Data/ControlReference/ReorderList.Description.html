 ReorderList is an ASP.NET AJAX control that implements a bulleted data-bound list with items that can be reordered interactively. To reorder items in the list, a user simply drags the item&#39;s control bar to its new location. Graphical feedback is shown where the item will be placed as it is dragged by the user. The data source is updated after the item is dropped in its new location.
